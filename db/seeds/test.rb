# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# User.create!(id:1,
#             name:  "Test User",
#              email: "f_sohey@yahoo.co.jp",
#              password:              "password",
#              password_confirmation: "password",
#              img_path: "default.img" ,
#              introduction: "testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest")
